  Bank Management System
This project aims to design a database and develop an application to manage the administration of a bank. The system is built using Java programming language and MySQL database.

The designed database will help organize information related to customers, employees, accounts, and transactions of the bank in an efficient manner, making it easier for the bank and its customers to access necessary information. Additionally, using the database, reports can be generated based on customer requests and the needs of the bank.

  Database Design
The database design began with an Entity-Relationship (E-R) diagram to understand the requirements. The E-R diagram visually represents entities and their relationships within the system. The tables in the database are designed following normalization rules and are in the Third Normal Form (3NF).

  Features
In this project, three roles exist within the bank system: customer, representative, and manager, each with its own interface and responsibilities.

  Customers
Customers can withdraw and deposit money from their accounts.
They can open new accounts or close existing ones.
Customers can transfer money between accounts.
They have the ability to update their information.
Customers can request and manage transfers and credit.

  Representatives
Each customer is assigned a representative.
Representatives can add, delete, or edit customer information.
They manage account opening, closing, and credit requests from customers.
Representatives can view and approve account-related requests from customers.
They can oversee transactions of their assigned customers.

  Managers
Managers have access to the overall financial state of the bank (income, expenses, profits, and total balance).
They can add new currencies (Dollar, Euro, Sterling, etc.) and update exchange rates.
Managers can set employee salaries, credit, and interest rates.
They have the ability to add new customers to the system.
Managers can advance the system by a month, triggering actions like salary payments, updating financial statements, and reflecting customer debts for the next month.
This project provides a comprehensive system for managing a bank's operations efficiently through a well-structured database and an intuitive Java application.
